# Typescript syntax

## Exercices

1. Declare variables (or constants) using basic primitive types
2. Declare an interface describing an Animal (interface should have at least two methods)
3. Declare a class that implements the Animal interface
    * implement one of the methods as a class (instance) method
    * implement one of the methods as a class (instance) field
4. Declare a variable to be of type string *or* number
5. Declare a variable to be of a type that combines both the Animal interface and an another interface of your choosing
6. Declare a variable to be an object that can have any number of fields of type number
7. Declare an interface that describes a function that takes a string and returns a string
8. Is it possible to extend the Animal interface without introducing another interface - try it in code
9. Is it possible to assign an object literal to a variable declared to be an instance of a class - try it in code
10. Pass a constructor function into another function
11. Convert your interface in exercise 7 to be use a generic type parameter
12. Give an example of using a guard clause to implement a function that accepts string or Date as a parameter
13. As 12, but your function should accept either a Buidling or Room or Site *class* (make sure each class has a different method)
14. As 12, but your function should accept either an Animal or Plant *interface* 
15. For the function you created in exercise 13, pass an object literal that looks like a Building
